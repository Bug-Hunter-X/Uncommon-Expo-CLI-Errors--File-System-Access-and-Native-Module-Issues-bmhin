This error typically occurs when you're working with Expo's managed workflow and encounter issues related to file system access or permissions.  For example, if you attempt to access a file from a location that your Expo project doesn't have permissions to access. Another case is using native modules which require specific configurations not set up correctly. A common source is incorrect path handling, especially when dealing with assets located outside the project's standard directories.  Incorrectly using the Expo filesystem API or other file system interaction methods that are incompatible with Expo's sandboxed environment will result in similar errors.
